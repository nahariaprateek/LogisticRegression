About Logistic Regression - logistic regression maximizes the log likelihood function to determine the beta coefficients of the model

Formula :-

Logit(pi) = 1/(1+ exp(-pi))

ln(pi/(1-pi)) = Beta_0 + Beta_1*X_1 + … + B_k*K_k

In this logistic regression equation, logit(pi) is the dependent or response variable and x is the independent variable. 

The beta parameter, or coefficient, in this model is commonly estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). 

This method tests different values of beta through multiple iterations to optimize for the best fit of log odds. 

All of these iterations produce the log likelihood function, and logistic regression seeks to maximize this function to find the best parameter estimate. 

Once the optimal coefficient (or coefficients if there is more than one independent variable) is found, the conditional 
probabilities for each observation can be calculated,logged, and summed together to yield a predicted probability. 

For binary classification, a probability less than .5 will predict 0 while a probability greater than 0 will predict 1. 

After the model has been computed, it’s best practice to evaluate the how well the model predicts the dependent variable, which is called goodness of fit. 

The Hosmer–Lemeshow test is a popular method to assess model fit.
